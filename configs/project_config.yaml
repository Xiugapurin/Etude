# Configuration for the project environment.

# Environment settings
# Note: Since we now use a unified environment with Demucs (replacing Spleeter)
# and custom beat tracking (replacing madmom), separate conda environments
# are no longer required for macOS compatibility.
env:
  # These are kept for backward compatibility but are no longer used
  # when running on macOS with the unified environment
  spleeter_env_name: "py38_spleeter"
  madmom_env_name: "py39_madmom"

  # Set to true to use the unified environment (recommended for macOS)
